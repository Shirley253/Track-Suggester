            <p>What is C#? It is a general-purpose language designed for developing
              apps on the Microsoft platform and requires the .NET framework on
              Windows to work. C# is often thought of as a hybrid that takes the
              best of C and C++ to create a truly modernized language. Although
              the .NET framework supports several other coding languages, C# has
              quickly become one of the most popular.
              C# can be used to create almost anything but is particularly strong
              at building Windows desktop applications and games. C# can also be
              used to develop web applications and has become increasingly popular
              for mobile development too. Cross-platform tools such as Xamarin allow
              apps written in C# to be used on almost any mobile device.
              C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.[15]
              Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version
              is C# 7.2, which was released in 2017 along with Visual Studio 2017
              version 15.5.[16]</p>
