            <p>What is C#? It is a general-purpose language designed for developing
              apps on the Microsoft platform and requires the .NET framework on
              Windows to work. C# is often thought of as a hybrid that takes the
              best of C and C++ to create a truly modernized language. Although
              the .NET framework supports several other coding languages, C# has
              quickly become one of the most popular.
              C# can be used to create almost anything but is particularly strong
              at building Windows desktop applications and games. C# can also be
              used to develop web applications and has become increasingly popular
              for mobile development too. Cross-platform tools such as Xamarin allow
              apps written in C# to be used on almost any mobile device.
              C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.[15]
              Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version
              is C# 7.2, which was released in 2017 along with Visual Studio 2017
              version 15.5.[16]</p>

            <p>Server-side scripting. This is the most traditional and main target
            field for PHP. You need three things to make this work: the PHP parser
            (CGI or server module), a web server and a web browser. You need to
            run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. You can access
            the PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the PHP page through
            the server. All these can run on your home machine if you are just
            experimenting with PHP programming. See the installation instructions
            section for more information.
            Command line scripting. You can make a PHP script to run it without
            any server or browser. You only need the PHP parser to use it this way.
            This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed using cron
            (on *nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). These scripts can
            also be used for simple text processing tasks. See the section about
            Command line usage of PHP for more information.
            Writing desktop applications. PHP is probably not the very best language
            to create a desktop application with a graphical user interface, but
            if you know PHP very well, and would like to use some advanced PHP
            features in your client-side applications you can also use PHP-GTK
            to write such programs. You also have the ability to write cross-platform
            applications this way. PHP-GTK is an extension to PHP, not available
            in the main distribution. If you are interested in PHP-GTK, visit Â»
            its own website.</p>
